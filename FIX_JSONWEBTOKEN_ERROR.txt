# ✅ JSONWEBTOKEN VERSION ERROR FIXED!

## 🎯 What Was Wrong:

Render build failed because:
- ❌ package.json had `jsonwebtoken@^9.1.0`
- ❌ This version doesn't exist on npm!
- ❌ npm couldn't find it
- ❌ Build failed

**Error:**
```
npm error notarget No matching version found for jsonwebtoken@^9.1.0
```

---

## ✅ What I Fixed:

Changed package.json:
```
❌ OLD: "jsonwebtoken": "^9.1.0",
✅ NEW: "jsonwebtoken": "^9.0.2",
```

Version 9.0.2 exists and works perfectly!
