## 🎬 Brand Story

**"CrypTalk was born from frustration."**

Three developers noticed a gap:
- Enterprise security apps are complex
- Consumer apps are simple but unsafe

So they asked: *"What if we could have both?"*

**The result:** CrypTalk - Military-grade encryption with consumer-friendly design.

Using WebAuthn (passwordless), NaCl (end-to-end), and zero-knowledge architecture, CrypTalk lets you chat securely without the complexity.
