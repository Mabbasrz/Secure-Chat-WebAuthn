# ⚠️ URGENT: IP WHITELIST NOT YET ADDED!

## 🚨 Current Status

Backend is still failing because:
```
❌ IP whitelist NOT added to MongoDB Atlas
❌ Render trying to connect: BLOCKED
❌ Backend can't reach MongoDB
```

**The error is still:**
```
Could not connect to any servers in your MongoDB Atlas cluster.
You're trying to access the database from an IP that isn't whitelisted.
```

```

### **Step 2: Left Sidebar → Network Access**
Look for "Network Access" under SECURITY section
Click it

```

### **Step 5: Click "CONFIRM"**

### **Step 6: Wait 1-2 Minutes**
MongoDB updates firewall rules

### **Step 7: Go Back to Render**
