## 🚀 DEPLOY ON RAILWAY NOW (5 MINUTES)

### STEP 1: Go to Railway
```
https://railway.app
```

### STEP 2: Sign In with GitHub
- Click "Login with GitHub"
- Authorize
- Done ✅

### STEP 3: Create New Project
- Click "New Project"
- Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
- Search "Secure-Chat-WebAuthn"
- Click to select your repository
- Click "Deploy"

### STEP 4: Railway Deploys Automatically
Railway will:
- ✅ Find Dockerfile
- ✅ Build your backend
- ✅ Start on port 3000
- Takes about 5-10 minutes

### STEP 5: Add Environment Variables
After deployment starts, go to Dashboard:

1. Find your service/project
2. Click on it
3. Go to "Variables" tab
4. Click "Add Variable"

**Add these 6 variables:**

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `MONGODB_URI` | `mongodb+srv://rizvismaraly_db_user:5BGGsj9WZZv5TsAb@cluster0.iw62a6n.mongodb.net/cryptalk?retryWrites=true&w=majority` |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` |
| `PORT` | `3000` |
| `JWT_SECRET` | `your-super-secret-jwt-key-min-32-chars` |
| `CORS_ORIGIN` | `*` (or your frontend URL later) |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | `another-random-secret-key` |

### STEP 6: Save Variables
After adding all variables:
- Click "Save"
- Railway restarts with new variables
- Backend connects to MongoDB
- **DONE!** ✅

### STEP 7: Get Your Backend URL
After deployment completes:
- Go to your service
- Find "Deployment" or "URL" section
- Your URL will be like: `https://cryptalk-api-prod.railway.app`
- Test it by opening in browser

---

## ✅ VERIFICATION

After deployment, test your backend:

1. Open your Railway backend URL in browser
2. You should see one of these:
   - ✅ API response
   - ✅ Health check message
   - ✅ Or no errors (means it's running)

If you see errors:
- Go to Railway "Logs"
- Check what's wrong
- Most likely: MongoDB URI incorrect

---

## 🌐 DEPLOY FRONTEND ON NETLIFY (OPTIONAL - 5 min)

### If you want frontend too:

1. Go to https://netlify.com
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Add new site
4. Select same repository
5. Build settings:
   - Base: `frontend`
   - Build: `npm install && npm run build`
   - Publish: `frontend/dist`
6. Deploy
7. Get your frontend URL: `https://your-site.netlify.app`

### Connect Frontend to Backend:
1. In Netlify, go to Build & Deploy → Environment
2. Add variable: `VITE_API_URL` = your Railway backend URL
3. Redeploy
4. Done! ✅
