## ⚠️ IMPORTANT REMINDERS

✅ **DO THIS FIRST:**
1. Configure Git with your name/email
2. Stage all files
3. Create commit
4. Verify `.env` is in `.gitignore`

⚠️ **DON'T FORGET:**
1. Make repository PUBLIC (not private)
2. Add all environment variables on Railway
3. Test live application after deployment
4. Share links on social media

❌ **AVOID THESE MISTAKES:**
1. Don't push `.env` with real API keys
2. Don't use private repository for portfolio
3. Don't deploy without testing
4. Don't forget to update README with live links
